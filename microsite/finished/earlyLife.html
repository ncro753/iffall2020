    <p>Woods began his success in USGA events (a success that would carry over to his professional career) three years before his first U.S. Amateur title. In 1991, Woods won the U.S. Junior Amateur for the first of his three consecutive championships. As a result, when you combine the U.S. Junior Amateur and U.S. Amateur titles, Woods won USGA events in a remarkable six straights years.</p>

    <p>Following his junior career Woods enrolled in Stanford and to nobodies surprise the wins kept piling up. Woods won his first tournament as a freshman in the fall of 1994, the William H. Tucker Invitational. The Stanford prodigy would go onto win a Stanford record eleven-times and his victories included the 1996 NCAA Division I Championship, NCAA West Regional and Pac-10 Championship.</p>

    <p>During his time at Stanford, Woods was a two- time All-American, a two-time Pac-10 first teamer and Player of the Year while he was also named the 1996 Jack Nicklaus Player of the Year.</p>
        
    <p>Throughout his amateur years, Woods played in 16 professional events, making the cut seven times. His first appearance was at the 1992 Nissan Los Angeles Open and his final was the 1996 British Open Championship where won the Silver Medal and finished tied for 22nd.</p>
        
    <p>Of the 16 events, six were majors -- the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open twice each-- and Woods made the cut on four occasions.</p>
        
    <p>Tiger Woods made his professional debut on August 29, 2016 at the Greater Milwaukee Open.</p>
