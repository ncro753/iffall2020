            <p>Woods is one of the best-known and most accomplished athletes of all time. As a child, he won three straight US Amateur titles. As a professional at age 21, he was the youngest Masters champion ever, winning by the largest margin in tournament history. Three years later, he won the US Open, British Open and the PGA Championship (his second), then added the 2001 Masters to become the only person to ever hold all four professional major titles at one time. With his legacy long established, Woods now stands among the best to ever play the game.</p>
